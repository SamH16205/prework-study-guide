# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The project functions a study guide that holds notes for the prework portion of a coding bootcamp. More specifically, it contains notes on introductory information about HTML, CSS, JaveScript and Git. I created this in order to learn about these programming languages and to gain some hands on programming experience. By creating this, I solved the problem of not having an organized space to take notes.

## Installation

## Usage

The program display information on the webpage as well as in the console. On the webpage, notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git are included, and well as an image of a cat and some CSS styling. The console displays a list of the topics in the study guide as well as a message instructing the user on what programming language they should study by using JavaScript to randomly select a language. To change what is displayed on the webpage or in the console, the files must be altered in VScode by naviagting to the file folder and typing and typing code . in the command line
